Title 	Perturbation of the metabolic phenotypes of vaccination by the gut microbiome in humans [phase I]
Organism 	Homo sapiens
Experiment type 	Expression profiling by array
Summary 	We performed an experiment in humans, in which broad spectrum antibiotics were administered to healthy young adults, prior and subsequent to vaccination with the seasonal influenza vaccine. Transcriptional profiling of peripheral blood mononuclear cells was performed prior to the vaccination and as a time course following the vaccine administration.
  	
Overall design 	A total of 22 study participants aged 18-45 received a trivalent influenza vaccine (TIV) on day 0. Eleven subjects were randomized to a five-day oral broad-spectrum antibiotic regimen consisting of neomycin, vancomycin, and metronidazole between day -3 and day 1. Vaccine was administered at Day 0. Biologic samples were collected and analyses performed at regular intervals.
