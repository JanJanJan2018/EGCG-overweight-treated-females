# EGCG-overweight-treated-females
NCBI gene expression data of overweight females treated with green tea (EGCG) or EGCG, fish oil, vitamin C, and Niacin over 70 days evaluating the blood after fasting

This was then compared with a series on males who were Russian and were either healthy or had Myocardial Infarction (MI) and analyze the genes that were expressed in overweight females and overweight females who were treated with EGCG (green tea extract). The platform file wasn't able to be uploaded as it is larger than 25 mb at 187 mb, GPL17586-45144, can be found at ncbi.nlm.nih.gov with a search.
 
 The series for the first study on overweight females and EGCG is: GSE74560 at https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE74560
 The series for the second study on males who either do or don't have MI is: GSE141512 at https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE141512
