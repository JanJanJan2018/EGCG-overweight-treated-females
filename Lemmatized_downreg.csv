This receptor is involved in several cellular processes, including intracellular signaling, lipid homeostasis, and clearance of apoptotic cells. In addition, the encoded protein is necessary for the alpha 2-macroglobulin-mediated clearance of secreted amyloid precursor protein and beta-amyloid, the main component of amyloid plaques found in Alzheimer patients. Expression of this gene decreases with age and has been found to be lower than controls in brain tissue from Alzheimer's disease patients.","LDL receptor related protein 1","ncbi gene"
"This gene encode a member of the SFRP family that contain a cysteine - rich domain homologous to the putative Wnt - bind site of frizzle protein. SFRPs act as soluble modulator of Wnt signal.

"This protein belong to the aldehyde dehydrogenase family of protein. This gene encode a mitochondrial NAD ( + ) - dependent succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase. A deficiency of this enzyme, know as 4 - hydroxybutyricaciduria, be a rare inborn error in the metabolism of the neurotransmitter 4 - aminobutyric acid ( GABA ). In response to the defect, physiologic fluid from patient accumulate GHB, a compound with numerous neuromodulatory property. Two transcript variant encode distinct isoform have be identify for this gene.","ALDH5A1","Down Regulated EGCG",0.509673429,"This protein belongs to the aldehyde dehydrogenase family of proteins.
